# Kotlin Interview Questions

__What is the difference between `val` and `var` in kotlin?__

_Solution:_

In kotlin, `val` is equivalent to java's final keyword. They are immutable , once assigned a value it cannot be changed. `var` is mutable like a normal variable.

__Are below statements syntactically correct?__

```kotlin
var number // line 1
number = 10 //line 2
```

_Solution:_

No. This gives us a compile time error. Kotlin uses type inference at compile time , that is inferes the type of a variable either from the value assigned to it or from the annotation of the datatype given. so the above line of code gives error as number doesnâ€™t explicitly mention  any of it and compiler cannot make out ,what type is number.

__Give the output of the following programme__

```kotlin
fun main() {

   var employee1 = Employee("maria", 1)
   var employee2 = Employee("john", 2)
   var employee3 = Employee("peter", 3)
   var employee4 = Employee("peter", 3)

   println(employee1 == employee2) 
   println(employee3 == employee4)

   println(employee1.equals(employee2))
   println(employee3.equals(employee4))  
 }

class Employee(var name: String, var id: Int) {

   override fun equals(obj: Any?): Boolean {

       if (obj is Employee) {
           return name == obj.name && id == obj.id
       }
       return false
   }
}
```

_Solution:_

`false, true, false, true`

== and .equals are both same in kotlin .Unlike in java they both check for structural equality.

__How do you check for referential equality in Kotlin?__

`===` using this triple equals operator.
